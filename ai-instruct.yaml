the @main.tf is actually an deployment for septiadi.com-backend
however i have lots of microservices
- fnb-pos using cloud run
- fnb-kds using cloud run
- fnb-inventory using cloud run

and each of them having 3 types of environment (dev, staging, prod)
i want you to make 
- module folder containing cloud-run deployment
- environments folder each having dev staging n prod
- inside env, there will be the deployment tf files for the microservices
- and each microservices implement the cloud-run module
- for now move the main.tf as septiadi.com-backend 
- and add dummy deployment tf for fnb-pos, fnb-kds and fnb-inventory
